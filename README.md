Simulation of wind-up toys and modular connector nodes for a game

This project came to me when I was trying to describe the AI for "Alien: Isolation" to a roommate of mine. I likened the Director AI/xenomorph relationship to that of a cheeky child winding up a toy and setting it loose on the player. Which made me think: what if a thinking, hunting, stalking xenomorph was a clockwork toy?

The possibilities are open: instead of an artificer *building* something, they could get a broken rusted relic on discount and set about repairing it. The result would be something modular, and where the modules' finer workings are unlocked through higher levels of investigation, mathematics, chemical engineering, microscopy, etc.
